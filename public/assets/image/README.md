# Nocturne Images

## 📁 Directory Purpose

This directory contains static images for the Nocturne application, including fallback images for the welcome page.

## 🖼️ Required File

Place your fallback image here with the following name:
- **nocturne-intro.png**

## 📐 Image Specifications

**Recommended Settings:**
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9
- File Size: Under 500KB (optimized)
- Color Space: sRGB

## 🎨 Content Guidelines

The fallback image should:
- Match the video's aesthetic
- Be a representative frame or scene
- Work well as a static background
- Maintain readability for overlaid text
- Use Nocturne's color palette (purples, blues, dark tones)

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- This image is used as:
  - Video poster (shown before video loads)
  - Fallback if video fails to load
  - Fallback for users with "prefers-reduced-motion" enabled
- Should be optimized for web (compressed)
- Should look good at various screen sizes

## 📝 Example File Structure

```
public/assets/image/
├── README.md (this file)
└── nocturne-intro.png (your fallback image)
```

## 🎨 Design Suggestions

Consider using:
- A graveyard scene with moon
- Gothic architecture silhouettes
- Purple/blue gradient sky
- Atmospheric fog or mist
- Subtle particle effects (if static)
- Nocturne logo or title
